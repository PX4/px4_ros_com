# Examples

This directory contains a set of examples application for the PX4-ROS2 bridge. All examples are intended to demonstrate basic interactions between PX4 and ROS2. Feel free to play with the code, extend it and copy it into your own project.

It is assumed that a reads has a basic understanding of running ROS2 applications as well as PX4.

# Layout

There are several separate examples. Each example assembles its own executable and can be used standalone to interact with a PX4 vehicle from your ROS2 environment.

The examples are structured:

* `listeners` 
   
   ...

* `publisher` ...

* `offboard` ...
